## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- MySQL database server installed and running.
- Required Python packages (`mysql-connector-python` and `tabulate`) installed. You can install them using pip:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Git-Utkarsh/SchoolManagementSystem.git
```

2. Install the rquired modules
```pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a MySQL database named `schooldb`:

```sql
mysql > create database if not exists schooldb;
mysql > use schooldb;
mysql > create table class(Reg int(20) primary key NOT NULL, Name Varchar(30) NOT NULL, Class Varchar(12) NOT NULL,
      > Sec Varchar(5) NOT NULL,Phone Varchar(20) NOT NULL,Father Varchar(30) NOT NULL,
      > Mother Varchar(30) NOT NULL ,Address Varchar(40) NOT NULL);

mysql > create table teacher(ID int(20) primary key NOT NULL, Name Varchar(30) NOT NULL, Subject Varchar(12) NOT NULL,
      > Phone Varchar(20) NOT NULL, Salary Varchar(20));
```

4. Update the database credentials in the code. You can change the host, user, and password in the `connection` line:

   ```python
   connection = sql.connect(host="localhost", user="root", passwd="root", database="schooldb")
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**:
   - Run the program using a Python interpreter. The program will start with a menu displaying various options.
   ```run
   python student_management.py
   ```

2. **Navigation**:
   - Use the numeric keys to navigate through the menu and perform different operations.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to input data and interact with the system.

3. **Exit**:
   - You can exit the program at any time by selecting the "Exit" option from the menu.
